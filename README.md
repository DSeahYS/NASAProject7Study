## 📥 Installation

git clone https://github.com/DSeahYS/NASAProject7Study.git
cd NASAProject7Study
pip install -r requirements.txt


## 🧪 Quickstart Example
from data_acquisition import SwiftLoader
from analysis import KilonovaModel

Load GW170817 counterpart data
grb = SwiftLoader.load_event('GRB170817A')

Initialize kilonova model
model = KilonovaModel(ejecta_mass=0.05, velocity=0.2)

Compare with observed NIR fluxes
model.fit(grb.wise_data)
print(f"χ² = {model.chi2:.2f}")
